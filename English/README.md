# 🥦 Smart Expiration Date Management App

> **Notice before you throw away.**
> Turn tomorrow's waste in your fridge into today's action.

---

## Experience (Three steps are all you need)

- **Register**: Enter food name, storage location, and expiration date with one tap (Refrigerated/Frozen/Room Temperature)
- **Notice**: Automatically prioritized lists for yesterday, today, and weekly use-up
- **Use Up**: Search and filter to see only the ingredients you should use now
> The goal isn't “zero waste.” It's a system to reduce waste without stress.

---

## How It Works (Shortest Route)

1. Add food (e.g., yogurt / refrigerated / expires in 5 days)<br>
2. App prioritizes items expiring in 2 days or less; same-day items get elevated to “action required”<br>
3. Weekly “Use-Up List” lets you check inventory before shopping

---

## Smart Notifications

- **Day Before & Same Day** Notifications (One consolidated notification)
- **Weekly Digest** visualizes inventory peaks
- **Quiet mode is default** for notification frequency (avoids disruption)

---

## Design

- **Organic** color palette and **minimal UI**
- One-handed operation. Contrast optimized for color blindness

---

## Technical Notes (Key Points Only)

- Flask + SQLite / Python / JS
- Authentication: Token-based / Hashed
- Future: Family sharing / Recipe integration / Shopping list export
